    <h3>lyrics</h3>
Summer's gotten warmer yet again
Never really mattered anyway
2 years since I've chosen self defence

Thanks for coming all this way to
Blame me
"How can you just be so grateless?"
I never claimed to need all this
Just having trouble to face it
Same shit
Seoul to berlin in the same whiff
Why's it been raining for ages
Why's it my phone can withstand this

I can't walk with a veil
Hovering over my head
As it grows heavy rain
Every mistake I make
And they talk with the sun
Lighting down on their face
And it falls
And it stalks
As if all this is stuck in my head
In my head
Mm
In my head

Right here underneath the weather
Flashing lights covered in magnets
Celebrating my displeasure
With picnics and banquets
Oh this shit's starting to get chronic
What if it's that I enjoy this
Performance
It's certain I don't have a choice
It's something I made
It's all fate

Thanks for coming all this way to
Blame me
"How can you just be so grateless?"
I never claimed to need all this
Just having trouble to face it
Same shit
Seoul to berlin in the same whiff
Why's it been raining for ages
Why's it my phone can withstand this

I've got nothing to say
Heart in the rain
Oh the report fucked it up once again
Puked on my face
24/7
Just took another and swallowed the pain
Walk in the torrent. Washing it down
As if I never have lived in this house
I had to run, didn't know what it changed
I had to run, but it's prolly to late

I can't walk with a veil
Hovering over my head
As it grows heavy rain
Every mistake I make
And they talk with the sun
Lighting down on their face
And it falls
And it stalks
As if all this is stuck in my head
In my head
Mm
In my head
