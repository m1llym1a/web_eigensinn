    <h3>lyrics</h3>
  I think I‘ve grown a certain caution for some things I can‘t see
Was it for me or was it for your relief?
Hid all repressions quickly under my sleeve
To make you think you‘ve got a hold of me
My damn perceptions under arrest by a sponsor
The kind that makes me think the most when I sleep
Again I‘m tethered to the back of the car

I said hold on
I‘m out of time
I wanna see you, but I vanish at nine
I was all wrong
I‘m out of touch
I guess I‘ll see you later in this device

Overdosed
I p-p-post my own collapse on the centerfold
Watch these bitches tryna cop me on the ropes
F-f-fu** the trigger warning I came for the strobes
I think I‘m overlo-o-o

Comatose
Topping the metrics with a song I don’t know who wrote
Been on this flight for way too long
In the cold
I guess I wanted you to find me
Didn‘t know it would strike me down

Hold on
I‘m out of time
I wanna see you, but I vanish at nine
I was all wrong
I‘m out of touch
I guess I‘ll see you later in this device

I wanna see you, but I vanish at nine

And if you‘re fu***** broken
Then turn up on the floor
And watch them turning blind here
Lose all of their control
Yeah down under the surface
We bussit til we sore
Oh if you‘re fu***** broken
Yeah if you‘re fu***** broken

I said hold on
I said hold on
I said hold on
I said hold on
