    <h3>lyrics</h3>
    As if I know what's up
My head just clocks along
I know your so upfront
But it just won't stop falling through
Just as the morning fades
I hear you end your day
Still I don't remember a thing you said
(What) could I have missed again?

Lose you as I love you
I can't let you fade away
Thought I'd get used to
Go missing when your bout to explain
Faced it. Not in control
I don't wanna lose you anymore
Lose you as I love you
I can't feel a part of my brain

Figured it doesn't work out so I cleared the cache
Dropping the tab for now
Funny it only took a sec for me to skip the add
Still couldn't hold the drought
Another second til I‘m full aware
That I been feeding my
Grown disposition
I shouldn't have fixed it now I'll

Lose you as I love you
I can't let you fade away
Thought I'd get used to
Go missing when your bout to explain
Faced it. Not in control
I don't wanna lose you anymore

Bound to hold my breath
Again, I'll hold you
Take the blame
So I can follow you

And I'll be home again
Right above the sun
Where nothing fades away
Where nothing is untold

I'll be home again

Lose you as I love you
I can't let you fade away
Thought I'd get used to
Go missing when your bout to explain
Lose you as I love you

Lose you as I love you
Lose you as I love you
