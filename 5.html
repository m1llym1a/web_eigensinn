        <h3>lyrics</h3>
    It's a tenant of a travesty
    Oh, she keeps on coming back to me (oh, oh)
    Though I got a lot to say
    It's the frame you put on my plea
    That just makes it hard to speak
    
    Lies clothing inside my thread
    But it doesn't fret these
    White noises, inside my head
    There's a dozen hectic thoughts
    I wanna comprehend
    But if everything is lodging back here
    How am I the one to pay?
    
    And it's not that I blame her
    Since she's far from the curtains
    I know there's no way she could tell
    But it seems that her focus
    Is a shot in my head
    At least I made her sane again
    
    Lies clothing inside my thread
    But it doesn't fret these
    White noises, inside my head
    There's a dozen hectic thoughts
    I wanna comprehend
    But if everything is lodging back here
    How am I the one to pay?
    How am I the one to pay?
    
    Lies clothing inside my thread
    But it doesn't fret these
    White noises, inside my head
    There's a dozen hectic thoughts
    I wanna comprehend
    But if everything is lodging back here
    How am I the one to pay?
